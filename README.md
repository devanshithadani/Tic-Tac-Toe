# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game in Python. The game can be played between two players on a 3x3 grid.
# Features
Two-player mode.


Simple grid layout.


Automatic detection of wins and draws.
# Insights and Key Learnings
Building this Tic-Tac-Toe game reinforced fundamental programming concepts like handling user input, managing game state, and detecting win conditions. It emphasized the importance of validating inputs and anticipating edge cases. The project also highlighted the value of modular code, making it easier to maintain and expand in the future. Overall, this simple project was a valuable exercise in applying Python to create an interactive, text-based game.
